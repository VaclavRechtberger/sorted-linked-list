# sorted-linked-list ![](https://github.com/vaclavRechtberger/sorted-linked-list/workflows/tests/badge.svg)
This project provides an implementation of the [List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) interface in Java, where elements are ordered. However, due to this characteristic, some methods deviate from the [List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) specification. For more details, refer to the [Javadoc](./src/main/java/io/github/vaclavrechtberger/util/SortedLinkedList.java).
